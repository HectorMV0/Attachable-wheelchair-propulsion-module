# Attachable-wheelchair-propulsion-module
The main goal of this project was to deliver a product that would assit wheelchair users in their movement, in the form of an attachable set of mechanized wheels, that could move in response to the user's manual control of the chair or through the use of a joystick. <br>

# What I did 
In this project, I was mainly responsible for the mechanical aspects of the module, which included to following tasks. <br>
1. I created the CAD model of the latching mechanism that allowed the module to attach to the chair, ensuring that the axis of the differential system alligned with the chair's own axis, as well as the chassis to hold the motorized wheels and transmit their thrust to the chair, and an actylic casing to house and protect the battery, the motor drivers and the electronic elements. <br>
2. I collaborated with my teammates to manufacture the different elements of the mechanical structure, which entailed the use of different techniques, such as welding, drilling and sawing for the metal parts, and laser cutting for the acrylic casing. <br>
